#CASTER THROUGHPUT SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS - Description

Based on the analysis of each parameter individually:

-->The most impactful width value is 1.970 meters, which results in the highest throughput compared to neighboring width values.

-->The most impactful thickness value is 0.280 meters, which leads to the highest throughput compared to neighboring thickness values.

-->The most impactful speed value is 2.550 meters per minute, which produces the highest throughput compared to neighboring speed values.

Therefore, based on this sensitivity analysis, it appears that the speed parameter has the most significant impact on the throughput calculation. However, as mentioned earlier, it's important to consider the combined effect of multiple parameters for a comprehensive analysis in practical scenarios.
