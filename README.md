# Sensitivity-Analysis
#HSM_SA_Mainfile - Description

Based on the analysis of each parameter individually:

--> The most impactful width value is 2.060 meters, which results in the highest coil weight compared to neighboring width values.
-->The most impactful length value is 11.833 meters, which leads to the highest coil weight compared to neighboring length values.
-->The most impactful thickness value is 0.280 meters, which produces the highest coil weight compared to neighboring thickness values.
Therefore, based on this sensitivity analysis, it appears that the length parameter has the most significant impact on the coil weight calculation. However, it's important to note that this analysis considers each parameter individually, while in practical scenarios, the combined effect of multiple parameters should also be taken into account for a comprehensive analysis.
